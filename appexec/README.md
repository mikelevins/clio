# appexec

A command-line executable skeleton for Common Lisp

## Overview

appexec is the skeleton of a command-line eecutable program in Common
Lisp. In other words, it's a Lisp project and ASDF system that can
easily build a command-line executable using a simple script.

Its purpose is to eparate out the boilerplate needed to turn a Lsp
program into a standalone executable to avoid the need to repeatedly
work out what's needed inorder to do that.
